#### About

Firefox Decrypt is a tool to extract passwords from Firefox/Thunderbird
profiles.

It can be used to recover passwords from a profile protected by a Master
Password as long as the latter is known.
If a profile is not protected by a Master Password, a password will still be
requested but can be left blank.

This tool does not try to crack or brute-force the Master Password in any way.
If the Master Password is not known it will simply fail to recover any data.

This script is written in Python and is compatible with versions 2.7+ and 3.4+.

Additionally it requires access to libnss3 which is part of Firefox and
Thunderbird, although depending on system configuration, the script may fail to
locate it there.

Alternatively you can install libnss3 (Debian/Ubuntu) or nss (Arch/Gentoo/...).
libnss3 is part of http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/pki/nss/


#### Usage

Simply run:

```
python firefox_decrypt.py
```

and it will prompt for which profile to use and the master password of that
profile.

If you don't keep your Firefox profiles on a standard folder you can call the
script with:

```
python firefox_decrypt.py /folder/containing/profiles.ini/
```

If you don't want to display all passwords on screen you can use:

```
python firefox_decrypt.py | grep -C2 keyword
```
where keyword is part of the expected output (URL, username, email, password ...)

Since version **0.4** it is now also possible to export stored passwords to
*pass* from http://passwordstore.org . To do so use:

```
python firefox_decrypt.py --export-pass
```
and **all** existing passwords will be exported after the pattern
`web/<address>[:<port>]` unless multiple credentials exist for the same website
in which case `/<login>` is appended.

There is currently no way of selectively exporting passwords.
Exporting overwrites existing passwords without warning. Make sure you have a
backup or are using the `pass git` functionality.

Starting with version **0.5.2** it is now possible to use a non-interactive mode which bypasses all prompts, including profile choice and master password.
Use it with `-n/--no-interactive`. Indicate your profile choice by passing `-c/--choice N` where N is the number of the profile you wish to decrypt (starting from **1**).
You can list all available profiles with `-l/--list` (to stdout).
Your master password is read from stdin.

    $ python firefox_decrypt.py --list
    1 -> l1u1xh65.default
    2 -> vuhdnx5b.YouTube
    3 -> 1d8vcool.newdefault
    4 -> ekof2ces.SEdu
    5 -> 8a52xmtt.Fresh

    $ read -sp "Master Password: " PASSWORD
    Master Password:

    $ echo $PASSWORD | python firefox_decrypt.py --no-interactive --choice 4
    Website:   https://login.example.com
    Username: 'john.doe'
    Password: '1n53cur3'

    Website:   https://example.org

    Password: 'Passwort1234'

    Website:   https://github.com

    Password: 'qJZo6FduRcHw'

    [...snip...]

    $ echo $PASSWORD | python firefox_decrypt.py -nc 1
    Website:   https://git-scm.com
    Username: 'foo'
    Password: 'bar'

    Website:   https://gitlab.com
    Username: 'whatdoesthefoxsay'
    Password: 'w00fw00f'

    $ # Unset Password
    $ PASSWORD=


#### Troubleshooting

If you run into problems please try running `firefox_decrypt` in high verbosity mode by calling it with:

```
python firefox_decrypt.py -vvv
```

If the output doesn't help you identify the cause and a solution to the problem please file a bug report including the verbose output.  
**NOTE**: Be aware that your profile password as well as other passwords may be visible in the output so make sure you remove any sensitive data before including it in the bug report.

##### Windows

If you are on Windows, make sure your Python and Firefox are both 32 or 64 bits.  
If you mix architectures the code will fail. More information on issue [#8](https://github.com/Unode/firefox_decrypt/issues/8).

#### Testing

If you wish to run the testsuite locally chdir into `tests/` and run `./run_all`

If any test fails on your system please ensure `libnss` is installed.

If afterwards tests still fail, re-run with `./run_all -v` and file a bug
report including this output. Please include some information about your
system, including linux distribution, and version of libnss/firefox.

It is much appreciated.
